/*
 Write a program which will convert a (large) number of seconds into a more readable time span which would include days, hours, minutes and seconds. Use an integer constant for total-seconds. Format the output something like this (where xx is a number that depends on the value of your constant):
 
 xx seconds equals xx days, xx hours, xx minutes and xx seconds.
